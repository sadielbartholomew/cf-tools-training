    "### What are the NCAS CF Data Tools and why do they all have 'cf' in the name?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _NCAS CF Data Tools_ are a suite of complementary Python libraries which are designed to facilitate working with data for research in the earth sciences and aligned domains. The two that are of most relevance to the average user, and those wanting to process, analyse and visualise atmospheric data, are *cf-python* (https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/) and *cf-plot* (https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-plot/build/). We will be focusing on use of cf-python and cf-plot today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'cf' in the names of the NCAS CF Data Tools corresponds to the _CF Conventions_, a metadata standard, because they are built around this standard in the form of using the CF Data Model, which as well as performance is considered a 'unique selling point' of the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the CF Conventions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _CF Conventions_, usually referred to in this way but also know by the full name of the **C**limate and **F**orecast (CF) metadata conventions, are a metadata standard which is becoming the de-facto convention to cover the description of geoscientific data so that sharing and intercomparison is simpler. See https://cfconventions.org/ for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we going to learn in this session?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **learning aim** is to be able to use the NCAS CF Data Tools Python libraries, namely cf-python and cf-plot to process, analyse and visualise netCDF and PP datasets, whilst appreciating the context and 'unique selling point' of the libraries as being built to use the CF Conventions, a metadata standard for earth science data, to make it simpler to do what you want to do with the datasets, by working on top of a Data Model for CF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have **six distinct objectives**, matching the sections in this notebook. By the end of this lesson you should be familiar and have practiced using cf-python and cf-plot to do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From netCDF to field constructs and back**: read in netCDF files, create a new field construct by modification of data and metadata and then write out the new field to a new netCDF file.\n",
    "2. **Basic data analysis, with plotting of results**: Plot the data before and after applying statistical collapses.\n",
    "3. **Regridding domains, with plotting of results**:  plot the data before and after regridding across spherical and cartesian coordinate systems."

    "<i>Note:</i> much of what you can do with cf-python you can do with the xarray library. Use whichever approach, the cf-python/cf-plot way, or the xarray way, works best for you! However, we want to emphasise that the NCAS CF Data Tools are built around the CF Conventions whereas xarray is not, so cf-python and cf-plot offer better metadata awareness to xarray, which could be a core advantage to our approach for users in/from geoscience.
